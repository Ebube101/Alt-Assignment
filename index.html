             My decision to join AltSchool's Cloud Engineering program stems
              from my ambition to expand my knowledge beyond cybersecurity 
              and delve into the world of cloud computing. 
              I want to gain a thorough understanding of cloud infrastructure,
               not just to penetrate and secure these environments 
               but to become an expert who can design, manage, and safeguard cloud systems with confidence.
     <br/>
               I was drawn to AltSchool by the numerous positive testimonials I've heard. 
               Although the tuition fees initially seemed high, 
               my passion for learning drove me to apply for a scholarship.
                Despite not receiving one, I remain resilient and optimistic, 
                knowing that this investment in my education will soon pay off.
                 Beyond the financial benefits, I am driven by the opportunity to 
                 live my dream—automating processes and securing assets for companies.
